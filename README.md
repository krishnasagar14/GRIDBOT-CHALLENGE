# GRIDBOT-CHALLENGE
Project for grid line following bot challenge at techfest 2011 IITB


This is lost and found project which is luckily restored. 
This project works with AVR C programming package on AVR atmega 16 model microcontroller.
Majorly, this microcontroller supports camera for processing at effective baud rate. Hence, this is future scope of the grid line following algorithm.
